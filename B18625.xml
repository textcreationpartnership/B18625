            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Act for this Lottery Establishes a Fond of 140000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> to pay the Adventurers their Annuities for 16 Years.</p>
            <p>This is Charged on the Duty on Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the 25th of <hi>March</hi> 1694, to the Seventeenth of <hi>May</hi> 1697. And after that, on se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Excises on Beer, Ale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were imposed by a Former Act, and then determine, and are by this Act continued.</p>
            <p>In this Act, there is a Clause whereby (in Case of Deficiency) the Lords of the Treasury are injoined to Supply it, by applying to this Fond, some other part of his Majesty's Revenue, not otherwise appropriated.</p>
            <p>But since (by Reason of the Insufficiency of the said Duty on Salt, and the diverting of it from this Fond) there has happened these Deficiencies, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Now the Adventurers are Inform'd, That this Honourable House have made, or are about to make some Provision for this Deficiency, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it to be but 140000 <hi>l.</hi> Whereas, upon Examination, it will appear, That what Deficiency there has been, and will be on the 17th of <hi>May,</hi> 1697, amounts to 240000 <hi>l.</hi> or near thereabouts.</p>
            <p>And there is not (that they know of) any part of his Majesty's Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, out of which this Deficiency can be supplyed.</p>
            <p>Many of the Adventurers are Foreigners, and some of them poor. And it would be needless to insist to this Honourable House, how much the Credit and Honour of the Nation, and of Parliamentary Fonds are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the due Payment of these Lottery Tickets.</p>
            <p>The Adventurers humbly propose, That the said 240000 <hi>l.</hi> and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest for each part thereof, from the time it ought to have been, or to be Paid; be Paid by or out of the Moneys to be raised by the Sale of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and more certain Interests in the Anuities of 14 <hi>l. per Cent. per An.</hi> And that in Case the same be not raised thereby, that it be made good out of the first, Aid to be granted the next Session of Parliament. And that Tallies of Loans for 50 <hi>l.</hi> or such like Summs be forthwith struck accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Or they Humbly desire such other Relief as this Honourable House shall think fit.</hi>
